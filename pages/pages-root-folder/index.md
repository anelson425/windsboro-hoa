Windsboro is a planned residential community of excellence in southeastern Lees Summit MO. We are a neighborhood of quiet peacefulness that is family oriented and socially active.

We have a convenient location with easy highway access, close proximity to excellent shopping and great local restaurants. Our resident students attend Lee's Summit High School, Pleasant Lea Middle School and Highland Park Elementary. The beautiful homes of Windsboro are surrounded by acres of green space accented by 5 ponds. Our neighborhood swimming pool is a favorite summer gathering place. It is also home to Windsboro Waves a recreational summer swim league. More information on Windsboro Waves on our activities page.
