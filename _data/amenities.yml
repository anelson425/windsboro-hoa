Guests are to be accompanied by a Windsboro resident. Windsboro Waves is a recreational summer swim team open to all kids 6 to 18 who live in the Highland Park Elementary attendance area. The season runs from Memorial Day through mid-July and includes daily weekday morning practices at the Windsboro pool and weekly swim meets against other L.S. subdivision teams.  Practices and meets focus on stroke refinement and improving endurance in a fun, supportive team environment. Registration begins in April.

- title: The Ponds
  text: The 5 ponds in Windsboro add much beauty and wildlife to our community. The Pond Committee will continue to evaluate all available measures to maintain the appearance and quality of the ponds including maintenance of dam structures, outlet structures, embankments and sediment forebay cleaning.  Several of the ponds have a variety of fish species ( catch and release only), turtles and other wildlife for the enjoyment of all Windsboro residents.
